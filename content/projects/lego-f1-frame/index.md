Okay so I don't know where this inspo came from. But for some reason, something about the Lego F1 McLaren handing on my wall felt right. The aesthetic fits. 

I knew I wanted to attempt 3D printed frames. Some of them suck. Designs and printers are getting better. This frame is originally for containing a 3D geographic map -- I have a related project of my own in the works. It is simple yet a bit complicated. Soon. The frame has a wooden texture that looks pretty realistic, I have to say. 

So now I need to adapt this for my F1. I found a file for wall mounting Lego F1s to the wall. Perfect. Now I need to create a backing. I pondered on a 3D printed backing, but ultimately decided I wanted to hang it against an exposed brick wall, and let rustic beauty do some work. 

I picked up a Non-Glare Styrene Sheet from Blick. With nothing flush up behind the sheet, it gives this frosted matte look. Love it. Really distinguishes the frame's background from the brick, but still uses the brick for styling. 

I printed the frames in Overture Black PLA, and scored my sheet. I botched the scoring. Two things: 1. I didn't clamp down my straight edge guide, letting my blade slip off the path an mark up the sheet 2. didn't cut to size, the sheet was just hair too large. 

I shaved the edges down and covered the horrendous edges with some gafter's tape. It blends with the black pla frame, hides the jagged edges, and retains up the Matte feel. 

Now to mount the F1 Lego Car. using my cutting mat to center the car, mark a center hole, and drilled the hole. The hole diameter is about exactly the same size as the screws inner diameter. I selected a screw with a coarse edge because it can self tap the styerene for a snug grip. Could have used a small screw and bolt, but the 3D printed wall mount uses ~45 degree countersunk screw head, only screw I have on hand that will match geometry and length are self tapping coarse wood screws. Doesn't matter much to be honest. 

I am happy with it! The original owner of the Photoframe does not allow for remixes, so I will just have to link the Bambulab MakerWorld file!!

Enjoy!
