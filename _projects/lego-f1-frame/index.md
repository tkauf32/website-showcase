Okay so I don't know where this inspo came from. But for some reason, something about the Lego F1 McLaren hanging on my wall felt right. The aesthetic fits.

I knew I wanted to attempt 3D printed frames. Some of them suck. Designs and printers are getting better. This frame was originally for a 3D geographic map ‚Äî I have a related project in the works. The geometry is simple, but the effect lands because of the surface finish.

So I adapted it for the F1. I used an existing wall-mount clip for Lego F1 cars, then focused on the backing. I considered a fully printed backer, but I wanted the exposed brick to do some of the visual work.

  </figure>
</div>

I printed the frames in **Overture Black PLA**, scored the styrene (poorly), and cleaned up the edges with **gaffer‚Äôs tape**. It blends with the black PLA and keeps the matte aesthetic. The wall mount geometry is ~45¬∞ countersunk, so I used a wood screw that matched head profile and length. A bolt+nut would also work.
