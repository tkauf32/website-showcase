I found this useful project on github for downloading 3D files from ikea's CDN. You can grab most files in a .gltf or .glb file format, comes with textures, and is quite dimensionally accurate. The project is well done as it leverages a browser plugin called ???monkeyjs??? (fix) to add a download button onto the website for items that are supported for download. 

I originally stumbled upon this project becasue I wanted to design  my room in blender before buying, building, and assembling a large desk from ikea. I soon learned how useful this downloading tool was since I was able to download entire caralogs of furniture items and port them into blender for visualization.

I did this for my room and a barbershop I built so I could make changes quickly and visualize the output. I have links to those project builds over on my YouTube if you want to check them out.

Blender is an extremely powerful, somehow free, tool 3d modeling. It is a great tool, however, for indoor spatial visualization, we have to import some model of the room. Initially, I measure out my room and manually build the walls, windows, doors, etc. However, using Polycam on a phone (I used an iPhone), I was able to 3D scan and capture the room in a simple way, exporting into a .usdz file format. I can then port that 3D file into blender. This saved a bit of time, but I wanted more immersion. 

Enter my Meta Quest 3 VR Headset. Full fledged immersion. Meta as of recently actually released immersive Gaussian Splats to explore. I have yet to try. However, I watched a Tik Tok of an artist making 3D sculptures in a VR headset, and I wanted to try in. Some quick research into 3D drawing and visualization apps lead me into Shape3D???? Toggling on passthrough mode on your left hand tool bar in the app will give you immersion into your environment. You can import files, draw, whatever your little heart desires for visualization. 

This is the next step. I wonder if I can build a meta quest app that enables a user to search/browse ikea catalogs, and with the click of a button, pull the 3D file into
