I found this really useful project on GitHub for downloading 3D files straight from Ikea's CDN. You can grab most files in a `.gltf` or `.glb` format ‚Äî complete with textures ‚Äî and they‚Äôre surprisingly dimensionally accurate. The project is super scrappy but clever. It works by using a browser userscript via [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) to inject a download button right onto Ikea‚Äôs product pages. Just click, download, and boom ‚Äî you‚Äôve got the model. They even provide a CLI tool if you want to batch pull entire catalogs, which is wild.

I originally stumbled across this because I wanted to design my room in Blender before buying and assembling a big Ikea desk. Once I saw how well it worked, I started pulling down whole catalogs of furniture and importing them into Blender for quick visualization.

I ended up doing this not just for my room, but also for a barbershop I was building out. It made the design process way faster since I could make changes on the fly and see the layout instantly. (I‚Äôve got links to those projects over on my YouTube if you want to check them out.)

### Capturing the Space
Blender is an insanely powerful ‚Äî and somehow free ‚Äî tool for 3D modeling. For indoor spatial visualization though, you need some kind of model of your actual room. At first, I just measured things and manually built walls, windows, and doors in Blender. It worked, but it was tedious.  

Then I tried using Polycam on my iPhone to 3D scan the room. Exporting into `.usdz` made it easy to import into Blender. That saved a bunch of time and gave me a more ‚Äúreal‚Äù base to work with. But I wanted to take it even further.

### Full Immersion with VR
Enter the Meta Quest 3. Pure immersion. Recently, Meta even released support for exploring immersive Gaussian Splats (still on my to-try list). But what really caught my attention was seeing a TikTok of an artist sculpting in VR. That blew my mind.  

I went digging and found [ShapeXR](https://www.shapexr.com/) (that‚Äôs the actual app name I was reaching for). Flip on passthrough mode and you‚Äôre suddenly sketching and arranging 3D furniture inside your real environment. You can import the Ikea models, draw, rearrange ‚Äî whatever your little heart wants. It‚Äôs like Blender, but in your living room.

### The Next Step
Naturally, my brain went: *what if I could build a Meta Quest app that lets you browse Ikea‚Äôs catalog, pick an item, and drop the 3D file directly into your VR space with one click?*  

That feels like the logical extension of this project ‚Äî straight from Ikea‚Äôs CDN into your headset, no Blender middleman required.  

Not sure if I‚Äôll build it, but it‚Äôs fun to imagine where this could go.
