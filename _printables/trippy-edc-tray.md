### MakerLab: [Trippy Tray](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1308800-trippy-tray?from=search#profileId-1342675)

For a friend’s housewarming, I printed a little “trippy tray” as an EDC catch-all. It’s a clever two-piece design: you first print the inner tray, pause the job (Bambu Studio has the pause built-in), drop the insert inside the casing, tack it down with a few dabs of super glue, and resume. Three dabs on different sides were plenty—I slid it into place, held for ~30 seconds, and the print carried on perfectly.

Once finished, I added four felt feet to the underside. Not only do they prevent scratches, but they also give the tray grip and that finished-product feel. I cut my own circles using a **Leather Circle Cutter Tool Set** with **0.04″ felt tape**.  
→ Small touch, but a big upgrade: the tray instantly went from *“3D print”* to *“actual product”*.
